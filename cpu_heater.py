#* Description: This is a simple software version of a Rube Goldberg Machine! *
#*              It was made to learn and to have fun while doing it.          *
#*              This is a CPU heater, but a really high tech version that has *
#* many technologies to achieve the processing of 16 threads simultaneous     *
#* each with 32 sums of 8 bits each in each clock. They are AVX2 256 bit      *
#* single instruction multiple data instructions.                             *
#* Although the code is small and simple.                                     *
#*                                                                            *
#* The architecture of the program is:                                        *
#*     Python using CTypes calls parallel and Single Instructions Multiple    *
#*     Data DLL in C that has inside Assembly instructions to determine the   *
#*     CPU capabilities.                                                      *
#*                                                                            *
#* This program uses the following technologies:                              *
#*   -Assembly for detecting if the CPU has AVX2 instructions and for         *
#*    detecting the number of logical cores.                                  *
#*   -C Programming with multi-threading and with AVX2 instructions using     *
#*    intrinsics.                                                             *
#*   -Make and GCC in the hybrid compilation of an shared library DLL with    *
#*    position independent code and a executable for the tests in C.          *
#*   -Python with CTypes wrapers to call the DLL shared library written in C  *
#*    and to process the heating timer.                                       *
#*                                                                            *
#* To install do:                                                             *
#*     make                                                                   *
